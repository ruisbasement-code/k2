# K2 Climbing

A 3D open-world climbing survival game on a real-scale K2, built with
[three.js](https://threejs.org) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev). The terrain is the
real mountain from the Copernicus GLO-30 elevation model (20 × 20 km around the
summit, 31.25 m grid).

This first step is about how it feels to move up the mountain.

## Run it

You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 18 or newer.

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

That opens the game at http://localhost:5173. Edits to the code reload the page
as you save.

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Runs the game locally with live reload |
| `npm test` | Runs the pace, stamina and movement tests |
| `npm run build` | Builds a static site into `dist/` |
| `npm run preview` | Serves the `dist/` build locally |

Every merge to `main` also tests and publishes the game to GitHub Pages
(`.github/workflows/web.yml`). Turn this on once in the repo's **Settings → Pages →
Build and deployment → Source: GitHub Actions**. The game is then at
https://ruisbasement-code.github.io/k2/.

### Controls

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| W A S D | Move (relative to the camera) |
| Shift | Push the pace: faster, but stamina drains much quicker (and it helps little up high) |
| C | Clip into / unclip from a fixed rope (within 5 m) |
| Space (hold) | Self-arrest when you start sliding |
| R | After dying: be rescued to the highest camp you reached |
| Mouse (click to capture), wheel | Look around, zoom |
| V | First / third person |
| T | Time speed: 1×, 5×, 10× (default), 20×, 60× |
| 1 – 9 | Jump to Base Camp, ABC, Camps 1–4, Bottleneck, Summit, Broad Peak |
| F | Scout fly (dev tool; E/Space up, Q down) |
| M | Mute breathing |
| Esc | Release the mouse |

## How movement works

**Time.** The mountain clock runs faster than real time (10× by default), so a
realistic pace still gets you somewhere. All the speeds below are in mountain time.

**Slopes.** Fixed ropes are the only aid for now (gear comes later):

- **Walking** below 25°. Speed follows Tobler's hiking function: about 5 km/h on
  the flat at sea level, much slower uphill.
- **Scrambling** from 25° to 35°: slow, tiring, and each minute carries a chance of
  slipping that grows with the angle, pushing the pace, and how slippery the surface is.
- **Above 35° only on a fixed rope.** Unroped, you can't go up it, and if you stand
  on ground steeper than its surface can hold you, you start to slide.
- **Fixed ropes**: press **C** within 5 m of the orange rope. You are not locked to
  the line: you move freely up to 8 m from it. Moving along the rope gets the jumar's
  speed, the rope gently steers you back toward its line as you drift, it lets you
  climb anything near it, and it catches you instead of letting you slip. Reach either
  end and you unclip. There are two ropes: the Abruzzi Spur from Advanced Base Camp to
  Camp 4, and the Bottleneck and Traverse from above Camp 4 to about 8,450 m.

**Surfaces** grip differently (`surfaces` in `tuning.json`): soft snow is slow going
but grippy, firm snow holds you to 35°, rock to 37°, scree to 33°, glacier ice to 30°,
and hard ice only to 27°. Ice slides the furthest and is the hardest to stop on.

**Falls.** A slip or too-steep ground starts a slide. You pick up speed down the
fall line, slowed by the surface's friction. Hold **Space** straight away to
self-arrest: it works while you are still slow (under 8 m/s) and within about 2
seconds, much better on snow than ice. Too fast, too late, or a hard hit, and you
tumble out of control (a ragdoll) until the ground eases and friction stops you.
Damage comes from how hard you hit the ground and from scraping over rock at speed,
not from how far you fell, so a long slide on snow can hurt less than a short drop
onto rock. Health heals slowly at rest and faster in a camp. At 0 you die, and **R**
gets you rescued to the highest camp you reached, hours later and still hurt.

**Day counter.** The top of the screen shows the expedition day, time and part of the
day. The sun rises around 05:30, passes high in the south and sets around 19:00, and
nights are dark. You start at 06:00 on day 1.

**Altitude.** Pace is scaled by an altitude curve for an acclimatized climber without
bottled oxygen. Steady pace while moving (`npm test` prints this table):

| Altitude | Walk 25° | Climb 40° | Rope 45° up | Rope 45° down |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 5,000 m | 436 m/h | 363 m/h | 412 m/h | 740 m/h |
| 6,000 m | 377 | 314 | 356 | 688 |
| 7,000 m | 276 | 229 | 260 | 588 |
| 8,000 m | 156 | 130 | 147 | 443 |
| 8,400 m | 104 | 87 | 99 | 362 |
| 8,600 m | 84 | 70 | 79 | 324 |

With rests, a steady climber takes about 13 hours of climbing from ABC to Camp 4,
and about 10 hours from 7,900 m to the top of the Traverse, close to a real summit morning.

**Stamina and breathing.**

- Stamina drains when you work harder than you can sustain: steady climbing drains
  it, and pushing drains it about 3× faster. It recovers when you rest or walk easily.
- Thin air drains it faster and refills it slower. Above 7,000 m it cannot refill
  completely: the white tick on the stamina bar is the most you can recover at your
  altitude (about 65% near the summit).
- Below 30% you slow down. At 0 you stop, gasping, until you have recovered a little.
- Your breathing rate follows effort and altitude. You see it in the pulsing ring,
  the edge of your vision darkens as you run out, and you hear it (M mutes it).

The HUD shows your altitude, slope, terrain mode, vertical speed now and over the
last mountain hour, the mountain clock, and distance to the summit.

All of these numbers live in [`src/data/tuning.json`](src/data/tuning.json), so
tuning is editing numbers, not code.

## Terrain

The terrain shader blends rock, scree, glacier, snow and ice from slope, altitude
and curvature:

- Snow collects in hollows and on slopes under about 50°, and wind strips the high ridges.
- Hard blue ice shows on steep faces above 5,700 m.
- The Godwin-Austen Glacier around Base Camp is rubble-covered ice streaked along its flow.
- Procedural detail and bump mapping fade with distance, and distant terrain sits in haze.

URL parameters set up a view for screenshots and testing, for example
`http://localhost:5173/?start&place=3&rope&pitch=10&dist=8`
(also `yaw=`, `fp`, `fly=<metres>`, `hour=<0-24>`).

## Data

Copernicus GLO-30 DSM tile N35 E076 (ESA, 2021 release), resampled to 641 × 641.
`public/data/k2_heightmap.f32` is little-endian float32 metres, row 0 at the north edge.
Camp positions are approximate and still need checking against a guidebook.
